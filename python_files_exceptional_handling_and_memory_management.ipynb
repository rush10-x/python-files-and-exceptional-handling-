Python uses a combination of reference counting and a garbage collection system to manage memory. When an object is created, memory is allocated for it, and when it is no longer needed (i.e., when there are no references to it), the memory can be reclaimed. This helps prevent memory leaks and optimizes the use of memory resources.\n",

        "2. Cycle Detection: Python also includes a cyclic garbage collector to detect and collect objects that are part of reference cycles (where two or more objects reference each other). This is necessary because reference counting alone cannot reclaim memory for objects that are still referenced by each other but are no longer accessible from the program.\n",
