        "- Memory management in Python refers to the process of allocating and deallocating memory for objects and data structures during the execution of a program. Python uses a combination of reference counting and a garbage collection system to manage memory. When an object is created, memory is allocated for it, and when it is no longer needed (i.e., when there are no references to it), the memory can be reclaimed. This helps prevent memory leaks and optimizes the use of memory resources.\n",

        "2. Preventing Memory Leaks: Without effective memory management, programs can consume more memory over time, leading to memory leaks that can slow down or crash applications.\n",

        "2. Cycle Detection: Python also includes a cyclic garbage collector to detect and collect objects that are part of reference cycles (where two or more objects reference each other). This is necessary because reference counting alone cannot reclaim memory for objects that are still referenced by each other but are no longer accessible from the program.\n",
